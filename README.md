# Kraskov mutual information.
Kraskov mutual information estimation between continious and discrete variables, 
based on approximate nearest neighbors calculation.

# Description
implementation of ["Mutual Information between Discrete and Continuous
Data Sets"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087357&type=printable), based on public library [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), for faster
nearest neighbors calculation.

# Usage
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```
